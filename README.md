ContacTap is an Android app that allows users quickly and easily exchange their profiles using a technique called NFC, Near-field communication. NFC can pair devices faster than Bluetooth and it doesn’t require Internet access. Therefore, when you meet a new friend and want to exchange contact information, you don’t need to swap your devices and type. What you need to do is to bring your devices close to each other and tap on the share button.
